        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
         Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br>
         when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make  a type <br>
        specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap <br>
         into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.It was popularised<br>
         in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum<br>
         passages, and more recently with desktop publishing  software like <br>
        Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.It is a long established <br>
         fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page <br>
        when looking at its layout.The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a<br>
        more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,<br>
         content
                here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop <br>
                publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum<br>
                 as their default model text, and a search 
                 for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover <br>many web sites still in their infancy.<br><br>
